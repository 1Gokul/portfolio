  `Hello! I'm Gokul. I am currently in the final year of my Computer Engineering degree. 
  My first brush with Web Development took place in 8th grade, where I made games using JavaScript.  
  I soon switched to OpenGL and then Unreal Engine to make games, before finally switching back to 
  webdev in college. I still develop in UE4 in my free time.`,

  `I am polishing my React skills right now with some projects, this website being one of them!`
