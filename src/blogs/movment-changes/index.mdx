The Character's movement has been updated with strafing depending on the Player's keyboard input.

In comparison, in the earlier versions, the Character would rotate in the direction of the keyboard input (done by 
setting `GetCharacterMovement()->bOrientRotationToMovement` to `true`).

## Setting up Animations

I downloaded six additional animations from Mixamo for each PlayerState: Strafe Walk & Run - **Left**, **Right** and **Back**. (I already
had the **Forward** Animations.)

Additionally, I added 4 Animations for *Diagonal* jogging in case the Player holds down one of the Forward and Right movement buttons simultaneously.

After setting up, the Animations were put in a **2D** BlendSpace (as opposed to the **1D** BlendSpace used before) like so:

<GatsbyImage alt="UnarmedNormal2DBlendSpace.jpg" image={getImage(props.localImages[0])} />

The Axes in the BlendSpace are **SpeedForward** (Y Axis) and **SpeedRight** (X Axis). These two values determine which Movement Animation has 
to be played. 

As the value of SpeedForward increases from `-375` to `375`, the **Backward** animations blend to the **Forward** animations. Similarly, as SpeedRight
increases, the Left animations blend to Right.

SpeedForward and SpeedRight are calculated as follows:

```cpp
FVector Speed = Pawn->GetVelocity();


SpeedForward = FVector::DotProduct(Pawn->GetActorForwardVector(), Speed);
SpeedRight = FVector::DotProduct(Pawn->GetActorRightVector(), Speed);

```

These two values are passed in the Animation Blueprint instead of `MovementSpeed`.

So as a result, the Character can strafe depending on the input instead of always rotating in the direction of input. 

## Other changes

 - Added a new map "SpringLandscape"
 - Changed the original camera position to be closer to the Character (Like the recent God Of War game).
 - Made the camera smoothly zoom in and out when the Character enters and leaves Combat Mode.
 - Added a crosshair that appears when the Character goes into Combat Mode.
