If the Player presses the 'Ctrl' key when in game, the Character will crouch. When crouched, walking speed is reduced, and
the Character also cannot jump _(might be changed)_ nor sprint.

A separate Crouched BlendSpace is used for the Movement Animations of the Character when crouched.

When the Character is in either the _Armed-OneHanded_ or _Armed-TwoHanded_ mode, it's Idle Animation is Blended with the Crouched BlendSpace
i.e the Idle Animation will play above the Pelvis, while the Crouched BlendSpace will play below the Pelvis.

For now, there is only one Attack Animation for the Character. I will add more when I can find them in Mixamo or when I make them
myself in Blender (Which I hope to do soon).
