### insertcoin-store

I and a classmate had made a mini-project for college that implemented Database concepts using MongoDB. I took it as a oppurtunity to skill myself in Web Development.

## The Project

The project was titled **"Insertcoin: Game Marketplace"**. We took the topic of a game markteplace as it involves all of the basic [**CRUD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations that were required in the mini-project.

The base layout of the website was made keeping [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) in mind.

## The Webpages

I first made a basic `home.html` page that had the basic layout of all pages of the site. All other webpages would be able to inherit from that layout by using `extends` like so:

`library.html`

```html
{% raw %} {% extends "layout.html" %}

<!-- **Page content** -->

{% block title %}
<title>insertcoin: Library</title>
{% endblock %} {% block content %}

<span class="pageheading">Library</span>

{% endblock %} {% endraw %}
```

The website's `home`, `login` and `register` pages inherit from `home.html`.

## Connecting to MongoDB

I signed up to MongoDB to use the free version of their [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) service. This database would be used to store the login information of the users.

After creating a database, I was able to acquire the connection string required to connect to the it. We can then connect using PyMongo like so:

```python
CONNECTION_STRING = os.environ.get("MONGO_KEY")
client = pymongo.MongoClient(CONNECTION_STRING)
```

Now any connected database would be accessible by `client['<db_name>']`!

## Registering to the website

`Register.html`

<GatsbyImage alt="register_html.png" image={getImage(props.localImages[1])} />

After the user submits the data required to register without any errors, their data gets added into a document in the Atlas database.

The `register()` function below checks if-

- The entered passwords match
- There is no existing user with the same username (using MongoDB's `find_one()` function)

and then pushes the data to the MongoDB document if both the coniditons are satisfied.

Passwords passed to the Database are hashed using the Python module **`Bcrypt`**.

```python
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def register():

    if request.method == 'POST':
        # If the passwords match
        if request.form['pass'] == request.form['passconfirm']:
            users = db['UserInfo']
            existing_user = users.find_one(
                {'username': request.form['username']})

            # If there is no existing user with the same username
            if existing_user is None:
                hashpass = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(
                    request.form['pass'].encode('utf-8'))
                users.insert({
                    'email': request.form['email'],
                    'profilename': request.form['profilename'],
                    'username': request.form['username'],
                    'password': hashpass,
                    'games': [],
                    'balance': 5000
                })
                # session['username'] = request.form['username']
                return render_template(
                    'login.html',
                    account="Log In",
                    comment='Your account was added successfully!')

            else:
                error = "The username that you entered already exists."
                return render_template('register.html',
                                       account="Log In",
                                       error=error)

        else:
            error = "The passwords you entered do not match."
            return render_template('register.html',
                                   account="Log In",
                                   error=error)

    else:
        return render_template('register.html',
                               account="Log In",
                               acclink=loginlink)

```

## Logging in

`login.html`

<GatsbyImage alt="login_html.png" image={getImage(props.localImages[0])} />

When the user submits the data, the function `find_one()` is used again to find out if the user exists in the database.
If yes, the user's password is compared to the password (again using **`Bcrypt`**) entered and if that matches too, the user is redirected to the **Library** page.

Using the `session` module, we can add an object `session['username']` with the user's username. This can be used later to check if there is a user currently logged in.

The `login()` function is as follows:

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        users = db['UserInfo']
        login_user = users.find_one({'username': request.form['username']})

        # if the user exists in the database
        if login_user:
            if bcrypt.check_password_hash(
                    login_user['password'],
                    request.form.get('pass', False).encode('utf-8')):
                session['username'] = request.form['username']
                return redirect(url_for('index'))

            else:
                error = "The username or password that you have entered is incorrect."
                return render_template('login.html',
                                    account="Log In",
                                    error=error)
        else:
            error = "The username or password that you have entered is incorrect."
            return render_template('login.html',
                                   account="Log In",
                                   error=error)

    else:
        return render_template('login.html', account="Log In")
```

## Logging out

Logging out is a easy process. We clear the **`session`** dictionary object with the key `'username'` using the function `session.pop()`, and then redirect the user back to the homepage.

```python
@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.pop('username', None)
    return redirect(url_for('index'))
```

The above code together forms a complete login system to log in to the website!
