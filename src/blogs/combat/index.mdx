# Melee

Attacks(for now) are very basic melee attacks with Swords, Maces and Axes. Attacks are performed when the Player presses the **LMB**.

Once the **LMB** is pressed, a check is done to see if the Player is not performing any other action at that time. If not, `MeleeAttack()` is called.

`MeleeAttack()` sets up the Character for attacks(Resets the IdleTimer, increments the AttackComboSection(Used for Combo Attacks)) and then calls
`PlayMeleeAttack()`.

## MeleeAttack()

```cpp
void AMain::MeleeAttack()
{
	ResetIdleTimer();

	if (!bAttacking && (MovementStatus != EMovementStatus::EMS_Dead))
	{
		bAttacking = true;

		SetInterpToEnemy(true);

		/** AttackSection
		 *  == 0 OR 1 -> Normal Attack
		 *  == 2 -> Combo Attack
		*/
		PlayMeleeAttack((AttackComboSection++) % NumberOfMeleeAttacks);
	}
}
```

`PlayMeleeAttack()` is responsible for using `AttackComboSection` to pick a particular animation out of the attack animations located in an
Anim Montage called `CombatMontage`.

## PlayMeleeAttack()

```cpp
void AMain::PlayMeleeAttack(int32 Section)
{
	UAnimInstance* AnimInstance = GetMesh()->GetAnimInstance();


	// Attack Sections start from 1
	Section += 1;


	if (AnimInstance && CombatMontage)
	{
		// Used for Enemy Hit Reaction
		if (EquippedWeapon)EquippedWeapon->MainAttackSection = Section;


		FString AttackName;

		// Append Section number

		// If attack is using a weapon
		if (bIsWeaponDrawn)
		{
			if (EquippedWeapon->bIsTwoHanded)AttackName.Append("TwoHandedAttack_");
			else AttackName.Append("OneHandedAttack_");

			if (!bCrouched)
			{
				// Get a random Final Combo Attack (Ranges from Attack_3 to Attack_5)
				if (Section == 3)Section += FMath::RandRange(0, NumberOfMeleeComboAttacks);
			}
			else
			{	// Only one Section for crouched attacks
				Section = 1;
				AttackName.Append("Crouched_");
			}
		}

		// else if melee attack
		else
		{
			// If Player has a Shield equipped, play the even-numbered attacks(right-handed attacks) only.
			if (PlayerStatus == EPlayerStatus::EPS_ShieldUnarmed)
			{
				// Override Section  todo Find a better way to find the even AttackSection
				Section = FMath::RandRange(2, 4);
				if (Section % 2)Section -= 1;	// Set Section to play the 2nd Animation if RandRange returns 3.
			}

			AttackName.Append("MeleeAttack_");
		}

		AttackName.AppendInt(Section);

		UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Attack = %s"), *AttackName);

		// Play Montage
		AnimInstance->Montage_Play(CombatMontage, 1.0f);
		AnimInstance->Montage_JumpToSection(*AttackName, CombatMontage);
	}
}
```

After the attack ends, `MeleeAttackEnd()` checks if the Player is still holding **LMB** down. If they are, `Attack()` will be called again.
If not, the Character will be restored to its normal state and will not be ready to attack.

## MeleeAttackEnd()

```cpp
void AMain::MeleeAttackEnd()
{
	bAttacking = false;

	SetInterpToEnemy(false);

	// Reset Swing Sound index
	SwingSoundIndex = 0;

	// Reset Combo Attack Section if Player does not press LMB within AttackComboSectionResetTime.
	GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer(AttackTimerHandle, this, &AMain::ResetMeleeAttackComboSection, AttackComboSectionResetTime);

	// If Player is still holding LMBDown, attack again.
	if (bLMBDown)
	{
		GetWorldTimerManager().ClearTimer(AttackTimerHandle);
		MeleeAttack();
	}
}
```

## Weapons

Following is one of the Weapons used in the game.

<GatsbyImage alt="GreatBlade.jpg" image={getImage(props.localImages[0])} />

The `CombatCollision` BoxCollision on the Weapon is used to check if the Weapon has hit an Enemy during an attack, very similar to
the `CombatCollision` on the Enemies.

## Checking for Hits

Anim Notifies are used in the attack animations to call functions during the attacks.

<GatsbyImage
  alt="OneHandedAttack2_AnimNotifies.jpg"
  image={getImage(props.localImages[1])}
/>

There are 4 main Anim Notifies used in attack animations:

1. **ActivateCollision**: Activates `CombatCollision` to check for overlaps during the attack.
2. **DeactivateCollision**: Deactivates `CombatCollision` after the attack has finished.
3. **SwingSound**: Plays a sword swoosh sound.
4. **AttackEnd**: Calls `AttackEnd()`.

If an overlap is detected by `CombatCollision` during an attack, its `OnOverlapBegin()` function gets called.

#### CombatOnOverlapBegin()

```cpp
void AWeapon::CombatOnOverlapBegin(UPrimitiveComponent* OverlappedComponent, AActor* OtherActor,
                                   UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndex, bool bFromSweep,
                                   const FHitResult& SweepResult)
{
	if (OtherActor)
	{
		AEnemy* Enemy = Cast<AEnemy>(OtherActor);

		// If OtherActor is an Enemy
		if (Enemy)
		{
			// Deactivate CombatCollisions of the Enemy in case their attack was interrupted
			Enemy->DeactivateCollisionLeft();
			Enemy->DeactivateCollisionRight();

			Enemy->AttackEnd();

			//Play Enemy Impact Animation
			Enemy->Impact(MainAttackSection);

			if (Enemy->HitParticles)
			{
				const USkeletalMeshSocket* WeaponSocket = SkeletalMesh->GetSocketByName("WeaponSocket");

				if (WeaponSocket)
				{
					FVector SocketLocation = WeaponSocket->GetSocketLocation(SkeletalMesh);

					// Spawn a particle effect at WeaponSocket
					UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation(GetWorld(), Enemy->HitParticles, SocketLocation,
					                                         FRotator(0.0f), true);
				}
			}
			if (Enemy->HitSound)
			{
				UGameplayStatics::PlaySound2D(this, Enemy->HitSound);
			}
			// Inflict damage on the Enemy
			if (DamageTypeClass)
			{
				UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage(Enemy, Damage, WeaponInstigator, this, DamageTypeClass);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The above function inflicts damage on the Enemy that the `CombatCollision` overlaps with, along with emitting particle effects
and impact sounds.

Attacks still have some minor bugs that will be fixed soon(example being the _occasional_ incident of attacks registering twice on Enemies).

Am seeing ways on making the combat more interesting. One option is adding powers to stun Enemies or to dodge their attacks.
