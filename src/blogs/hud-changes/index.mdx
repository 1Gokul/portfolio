Changed the HUD's position to be similar to Skyrim's HUD. The Health and Stamina bar are in the bottom center and bottom right respectively.

Now, the Health and Stamina in the bars decrease from the sides to the center. Will try an add a pulsing animation to the Stamina bar if
the Character is sprinting. Also may make the HUD fade out if the Player was idle(might connect it to the Idle Timer).

The coin count will now be shown at the bottom of the Inventory menu.

Also made a small 'tickmark' appear next to the Save or Load buttons when the Player clicks on them.

The problem of the Character rising above the ground was fixed too. I just had to retarget the Animations again from the Mixamo model 
to the UE4 mannequin. Not sure why it didn't work properly the last time.
