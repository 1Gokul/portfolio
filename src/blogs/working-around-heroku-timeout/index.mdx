title: "Working around Heroku's 30-second timeout"

### Pic2ASCII

If you have used Heroku as a platform for your web applications, you would have found out that it has a **30-second** timeout for any type of request. This becomes a problem for any apps that involve uploading or processing of large files.

In the [previous](/pic2ascii/2020-12-11/pic2ascii-converter/) **Pic2ASCII** post, you can see that there are 3 main operations: _uploading_ the submitted file, _processing_ it, and _uploading_ it again to show the processed image. On top of all that, the duration these tasks take _heavily_ depends on the size of the files submitted.

As the API can expect large image files to convert, I eventually got the `"Application Error"` page, as the requests to upload to Imgur took it past Heroku's 30-second limit.

Changing gunicorn's timeout duration in the `Procfile` would also not work and would still timeout after 30 seconds.

## The Workaround

I had 2 ways to upload the images to Imgur:

[1.Sending the image through an Ajax POST request in JQuery](#using-jquery-and-ajax)

Or

[2.Uploading files as a background task using **R**edis **Q**ueue.](#using-redis-and-ajax)

I personally prefer the second option because _(familiarity and bias towards Python aside,)_ the functions made can be _easily_ reused for other purposes, not just uploading.

The second method was also used for the API's conversion functions.

## Using JQuery and Ajax

Once the **Submit** button is clicked, its [click()](https://api.jquery.com/click/) function in the `input.js` file would be called and the file would be taken.

The file is first checked to see if it is valid and falls within the 20MB size limit that Imgur sets.

```js
// Get the file from the form
var $file = $("#inputform-file").prop("files")[0];

if ($file) {
  var fileType = $file["type"];

  // If the file's type is not supported
  var validImageTypes = ["image/gif", "image/jpeg", "image/png"];
  if ($.inArray(fileType, validImageTypes) < 0) {
    send_error("Select a <b>valid</b> image file.");
  }

  // Else if file is larger than 20MB(Imgur's upload size limit)
  else if ($file.size > parseInt(maxFileSize) * 1024 * 1024) {
    send_error(
      "The file was bigger than the 20MB limit! Select a smaller one."
    );
    return false;
  }
  // Else if the file is good to go
  else {
    if ($("#error").length) {
      send_error("Nice!");
    }

    // Disable the submit button to prevent repeated submissions.
    $(this).css("background", "#d44444");
    $(this).val("Uploading...").attr("disabled", "disabled");

    console.log("uploading submitted file...");
    send_file_to_upload($file, "convert_image");
  }
}
// If no file was selected at all
else {
  send_error("Select a file first, goofball.");
}
```

If valid, an Ajax POST request with the image's data would be sent to Imgur, with help taken from their [API documentation](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#c85c9dfc-7487-4de2-9ecd-66f727cf3139).

`upload_to_imgur()`

```js
// Send an Ajax POST request to Imgur's API to upload a file.
function upload_to_imgur(fileToUpload) {
  // The image's data
  var formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("image", fileToUpload);

  // Taken from: https://apidocs.imgur.com/#c85c9dfc-7487-4de2-9ecd-66f727cf3139
  var settings = {
    url: "https://api.imgur.com/3/image",
    method: "POST",
    timeout: 0,
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Client-ID "
    },
    processData: false,
    mimeType: "multipart/form-data",
    contentType: false,
    data: formData
  };

  // Upload the file to Imgur.
  var parsedResponse;

  $.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
    // Parse the returned JSON and return the link to the image.
    parsedResponse = $.parseJSON(response);

    return parsedResponse.data.link;
  });
}
```

Conversion would take place as usual in the API, and the resultant image file would be again returned and uploaded to Imgur using the same method.

This method works properly without any timeouts, with the exceptions being _unusually_ large files, which would cause a timeout during their conversion.

## Using Redis and AJAX

In this method, each task is done in this manner:

- In the view function, once called, create a task and add it to the Redis Queue and then return the task's ID.
- In JQuery, after receiving the ID of the task, keep checking if the task is complete (every second) and access the results and errors in the returned JSON file.

Let us take the example of uploading a file:

### Example: Uploading a file

Like the above method, the file is checked to see if it is valid. After that, an Ajax POST request is sent to the view function `upload_file()` in the API.

```js
window.send_file_to_upload = function ($file, funcToCallOnceCompleted) {
  // Would be accessed as a form in the API
  var formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", $file);

  // Ajax POST request to upload_file() in the API
  $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: Flask.url_for("upload_file"),
    data: formData,
    cache: false,
    processData: false,
    contentType: false
  })
    // If done, get the status of the background job that was started for this file's upload.
    .done((response) => {
      get_status(response.data.taskID, funcToCallOnceCompleted);
    })

    .fail((error) => {
      console.log("Error during file upload: " + error);
    });
};
```

In the API, `upload_file()` then creates a task and begins the conversion like so:

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if (request.method == 'POST'):
        if (is_base64(request.files.get('file'))):
            imgData = request.files.get('file')
        else:
            imgData = b64encode(request.files.get('file').read())

    # Start the upload as a background task in the Redis queue
    task = q.enqueue(upload_image, imgData)

    # create a dictionary with the ID of the task
    responseObject = {"status": "success", "data": {"taskID": task.get_id()}}
    # return the dictionary as JSON
    return jsonify(responseObject)
```

The functions which are part of the tasks put in the Queue (like `upload_image()` above) are kept in a separate file, `imageoperations.py`.

Once the function returns the ID of the task, we can start checking if the task is complete. Using JavaScript's [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) function, we can check the status by calling the `get_status()` view function every 1000 milliseconds.

### In the browser

```javascript
/* Get the status of the task from the API.
       funcToCall is the name of the function to call once the task returns 'finished' 
    */
function get_status(taskID, funcToCall) {
  $.ajax({
    method: "GET",
    url: `tasks/${taskID}`
  })
    .done((response) => {
      const taskStatus = response.data.taskStatus;

      if (taskStatus === "failed") {
        console.log(response);
        return false;
      } else if (taskStatus == "finished") {
        // Parse the returned JSON and return the link to the image.
        console.log(response);

        window[funcToCall](
          response.data.taskResult.result,
          response.data.taskResult.errors
        );
        return false;
      }

      // If the task hasn't been finished, try again in 1 second.
      setTimeout(function () {
        get_status(response.data.taskID, funcToCall);
      }, 1000);
    })
    .fail((error) => {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
```

### In the API

```python
@app.route('/tasks/<taskID>', methods=['GET'])
def get_status(taskID):
    task = q.fetch_job(taskID)

    # If such a job exists, return its info
    if (task):
        responseObject = {
            "success": "success",
            "data": {
                "taskID": task.get_id(),
                "taskStatus": task.get_status(),
                "taskResult": task.result
            }
        }

    # Else, return an error
    else:
        responseObject = {"status": "error"}

    return responseObject
```

So, once the task is completed, the status returned is either **'finished'** or **'failed'**. If finished, the result is taken from the returned JSON file (responseObject from the view function).

In PicASCII, image conversion and uploading of the converted image is also done with this method.

The result is no timeouts!
